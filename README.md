Programming language(s) i know.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Language | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Python üêç | Python is my main programming language. It's very good for beginners but it can be very advanced with making nueral networks. |
| Java ‚òï | I know very little of Java, but from what i have seen im gonna enjoy it a lot. It looks like a great challenge. |

Programming languages i would like to learn.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Language | Description |
| --- | --- |
| C++ | I want to learn C++ because it's mainly used in the gaming industry and one of my dream jobs is too work at Naughty Dog as a AI Programmer or any other programming job :) |
| Kotlin | I want to learn Kotlin because it making apps for Android must really fun and looks like a good  challenge. |

What im working on now.

| Projects | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Discord Bot | At the moment my main priority is my discord bot, named Weenur Pod. It's a simple bot which can play 8ball with you, find somebody's ID. The discord bot still isn't finished but im gonna be working on him slowly. If you want to see the code for the discord bot, visit my profile and click on the discord-bot repo. |
| Neural network | My next project after the discord bot is any neural network using the tensorflow libary. The reason i want to learn this is because it will help in my college course and also because it's incredible how you can train a computer too recognise something that you trained it too. I'm gonna train the neural network to see if can tell apart a car and a bus. |
